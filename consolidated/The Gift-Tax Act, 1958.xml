            <p>If the Assessing Officer, has reason to believe that the taxable gifts in respect of which any person is assessable under this Act (whether made by him or by any other person) have escaped assessment for any assessment year (whether by reason of under-assessment or assessment at too low a rate or otherwise), he may, subject to the other pro visions of this section and section 16A, serve on such person a notice requiring him to furnish within such period,  as may be specified in the notice, a return in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner, setting forth the taxable gifts made by him or by such other person during the previous year mentioned in the notice, in respect of which he is assessable, along with such other particulars as may be required by the notice, and may proceed to assess or reassess such gifts and also any other taxable gifts in respect of which such person is assessable, which have escaped assessment and which come to his notice subsequently in the course of the proceedings under this section for the assessment year concerned (hereafter in this section referred to as the relevant assessment year); and the provisions of this Act shall, so far as may be apply as if the return were a return required under section 13:</p>
            <p>Provided that where an assessment under sub-section (3) of section 15 or this section has been made for the relevant assessment year, no action shall be taken under this section after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year, unless any taxable gift chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for such assessment year by reason of the failure on the part of the assessee to make a return under section 13 or section 14 or in response to a notice issued under sub-section (4) of section 15 or this section or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for year:</p>
            <p>Provided further that the Assessing Officer shall, before issuing any notice under this sub-section, record his reasons for doing so.</p>
            <p>Explanation.--Production before the Assessing Officer of account books or other evidence from which material evidence could with due diligence have been discovered by the Assessing Officer will not necessarily amount to disclosure within the meaning of the foregoing proviso.</p>
