Explanation:— For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that in a case where the provisions of section 68J are applicable, no notice under this section shall be invalid merely on the ground that it fails to mention the evidence relied upon or it fails to establish a direct nexus between the property sought to be forfeited and any activity in contravention of the provisions of this Act.

68I.Forfeiture of property in certain cases.—(1)
The competent authority may, after considering the explanation, if any, to the show cause notice issued under section 68H, and the materials available before it and after giving to the person affected (and in a case where the person affected holds any property specified in the notice through any other person, to such other person also) a reasonable opportunity of being heard, by order, record a finding whether all or any of the properties in question are illegally acquired properties:

Provided that if the person affected (and in a case where the person affected holds any property specified in the notice through any other person such other person also) does not appear before the competent authority or represent his case before it within a period of thirty days specified in the show cause notice, the competent authority may proceed to record a finding under this sub-section ex parte on the basis of evidence available before it.

(2)
Where the competent authority is satisfied that some of the properties referred to in the show cause notice are illegally acquired properties but is not able to identify specifically such properties, then, it shall be lawful for the competent authority to specify the properties which, to the best of its judgment, are illegally acquired properties and record a finding accordingly under subsection (1).

(3)
Where the competent authority records a finding under this section to the effect that any property is illegally acquired property, it shall declare that such property shall, subject to the provisions of this Chapter stand forfeited to the Central Government free from all encumbrances:

68K.Fine in lieu of forfeiture.—(1)
Where the competent authority makes a declaration that any property stands forfeited to the Central Government under section 68-I and it is a case where the source of only a part of the illegally acquired property has not been proved to the satisfaction of the competent authority, it shall make an order giving an option to the person affected to pay, in lieu of forfeiture, a fine equal to the market value of such part.

In the case of any person referred to in sub-clause (vi) of clause (b) of section 68B, if the competent authority, on the basis of the information and materials available to it, has reason to believe (the reasons for such belief to be recorded in writing) that any property held in trust is illegally acquired property, it may serve a notice upon the author of the trust or as the case may be, the contributor of the assets out of or by means of which such property was acquired by the trust and the trustees, calling upon them within a period of thirty days specified in the notice, to explain the source of money or other assets out of or by means of which such property was acquired or, as the case may be, the source of money or other assets which were contributed to the trust for acquiring such property and thereupon such notice shall be deemed to be a notice served under section 68H and all the other provisions of this Chapter shall apply accordingly.

Explanation:— For the purposes of this section "illegally acquired property", in relation to any property held in trust, includes— (i)
any property which if it had continued to be held by the author of the trust or the contributor of such property to the trust would have been illegally acquired property in relation to such author or contributor;
