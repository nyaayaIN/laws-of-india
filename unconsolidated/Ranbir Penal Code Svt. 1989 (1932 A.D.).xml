              <p>Explanation 2- Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented.</p>
              <p>Explanation 3- The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth though the child may not have breathed or been completely born.</p>

              <p>Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or-</p>
              <p>Secondly- If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or-</p>
              <p>Thirdly- If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or-</p>
              <p>Fourthly- If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.</p>
              <p>Exception I.- When culpable homicide is not murder-Culpable is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.</p>
              <p>The above exception is subject to the following provisos</p>
              <p>First- That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person.</p>
              <p>Secondly- That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant.</p>
              <p>Thirdly- That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.</p>
              <p>Explanation- Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact,</p>
              <p>Exception 2- Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence</p>
              <p>Exception 3- Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill will towards the person whose death is caused.</p>
              <p>Exception 4- Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.</p>
              <p>Explanation- It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.</p>
              <p>Exception 5.- Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.</p>

              <p>Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.</p>
              <p>Explanation 1.- A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth.</p>
              <p>Explanation 2.- A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft.</p>
              <p>Explanation 3.- A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.</p>
              <p>Explanation 4.- A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.</p>
              <p>Explanation 5.- The consent mentioned in the definition may be expression or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied.</p>

              <p>In all robbery there is either theft or extortion.</p>
              <p>When theft is robbery.</p>
              <p>Theft is "robbery" if, in order to the committing of the theft, or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, for that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt, or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.</p>
              <p>When extortion is robbery.</p>
              <p>Extortion is "robbery" if the offender, at the time of committing the extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in fear of instant death, or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person, or to some other person, and by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted.</p>
              <p>Explanation.- The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in fear of instant death, or of instant hurt, or instant wrongful restraint.</p>
